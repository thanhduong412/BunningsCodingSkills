# Coding Skills Challenge
Thanh Duong's attempt at the Bunnings Coding Skills Challenge. Challenge was completed with a focus on successfully completing the mega merge. As such, no UI was developed. Code was written to be extensible in the future for feature such as this. Unit test was done as proof of knowledge to save time. 

JavaDocs also provided for your reference.

Thanking you again for the opportunity.

### Usage
```bash
java controller.Controller
